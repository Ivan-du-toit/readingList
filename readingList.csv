https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/inverse-cramer-etf-is-coming-to-the-real-world?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav,Inverse Cramer ETF is coming to the real world | Nasdaq,"Previously in May,¬†I wrote about what a hypothetical ""Inverse Jim Cramer"" ETF¬†would look like. It's worth noting that the concept of ""inversing Cramer"" was highly popular on social media like r/WallStreetBets given his spotty track record.¬†At the time, I figured inverse Cramer would remain a meme. Well, I was proven wrong. An enterprising and clearly meme-savvy fund manager out there,¬†Tuttle Capital Management¬†has actually filed prospectuses for two Cramer-tracking funds:The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM)The Long Cramer ETF (LJIM)In retrospect, I'm not surprised. Tuttle Capital is known for its hilarious yet strangely effective ETF lineup. Case in point, their earlier¬†Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK)¬†that bet against Cathie Wood and her funds is still up 73% year-to-date.¬†How the Inverse Cramer ETF might workMake no mistake, SJIM and LJIM will be actively managed funds. Although¬†Index One was able to construct an Inverse Cramer tracking index, the actual operations of a Cramer-based fund would be significantly more complex. This is not your vanilla buy-and-hold index fund.¬†According to Tuttle Capital, both ETFs will hold 20-25 Cramer picks in an equally weighted allocation. Because Cramer often makes his picks live on TV (or via tweets), the fund will likely have significant turnover to maintain low tracking error with Cramer's recommendations. I'm curious to see if there will be large capital gains distributions every year due to this.¬†SJIM is the more interesting fund in my opinion and will require some intricacies to carry out its daily inverse exposure target. This will likely necessitate shorting or the use of total return swaps. I'm curious to see if the team at Tuttle plans on using options given their complexity and susceptibility to time decay and changes in implied volatility.¬†In many ways, SJIM is basically a long-short alternative fund. If Cramer is bullish a pick, the fund shorts it. If Cramer is bearish on a pick, the fund goes long on it. Buying the fund means basically betting against Cramer in the most explicit and hilarious of ways.Benefits and risks of SJIM ETFThe premise behind SJIM is theoretically sound and can be boiled down to one observation: ""the average stock picker performs horribly .""Stock-picking is extremely difficult to pull off consistently. Everyone is a genius in a bull market, but during bear markets like these, the average stock picker tends to trail a simple index fund significantly.¬†Case in point,¬†studies have found¬†that¬†just a handful of stocks (86 in total) account for half of the total stock market's return in the last 90 years, with 96% underperforming risk-free Treasury Bills.¬†Another study¬†found that a blindfolded monkey could beat most stock pickers. Unless you think he‚Äôs a prophet with his stock picks, betting against Cramer is like betting against any stock picker.¬†What is the bull case for SJIM then? In a nutshell, the fund would likely outperform if just over half of Cramer's picks were wrong in the short term. The inverse exposure will likely be reset daily like most inverse ETFs on the market. Thus, the best-case scenario is a sudden, volatile movement against one of Cramer's recommendations that the fund trades in and out of.¬†Most inverse funds have high negative carry due to the positive expected returns of the underlying, volatility drag, and high expense ratios. SJIM could feasibly post a positive long-term return if Cramer was consistently wrong with his picks over the short term, the fund doesn't employ leverage (which amplifies volatility drag), and keeps expense ratios low enough.¬†¬†If you're dead set on betting against Cramer, SJIM might be one of the safer ways to do so. Otherwise, you'll have to actively manage dozens of positions, keep up to date with Cramer's news segments and Twitter, use margin to sell stocks short, or fiddle with options. At least with an ETF, your maximum risk is limited to your total investment.",https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg,2023-04-13T22:40:28.735969896Z,,

https://ianthehenry.com/posts/generalized-macros/,Generalized Macros,"I‚Äôve been writing a lot of Janet lately, and I‚Äôve been especially enjoying my time with the macro system. Janet macros are Common Lisp-flavored unhygienic gensym-style macros. They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It‚Äôs easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they‚Äôre expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time. So people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely ‚Äì sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity ‚Äì and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing. But as far as I know, no one has approached macro systems from the other direction. No one looked at Common Lisp‚Äôs macros and said ‚ÄúWhat if these macros aren‚Äôt dangerous enough? What if we could make them even harder to write correctly, in order to marginally increase their power and expressiveness?‚Äù So welcome to my blog post.",https://ianthehenry.com/checkerboard.png,2023-04-18T23:47:36.989353412Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35614023,

I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, posted them on a Twitter thread, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I&rsquo;ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and&hellip; nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it&rsquo;s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally. To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem. To open up, I&rsquo;ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?

This blog post delves into the intricacies of these scaling laws and examines how they guide the development of more powerful and efficient LLMs. I will be as comprehensive as I can (with the math knowledge I have) including parts about the scaling law origins, recent finding and their implications.",,2023-12-21T04:06:59.059652637Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38707668,

But the feedback afterwards was quite positive and there were some questions too, so here's the extended version for anyone interested. Note that our team conducts pre-merge reviews, and some of the suggestions are specific to that context. I actually prefer post-merge reviews, but am yet to persuade everyone I work with that they're better.

This is an issue very close to my heart. I spent over a decade in American academia, at several different very wealthy institutions, and every semester of my experience was marred by major, highly disruptive, noisy and openly unnecessary building. Most of these schools have a long line of extravagant projects planned generations into the future. They routinely tear down structures thrown up mere decades ago, only to replace them with larger and newer architectural monstrosities double or triple the original size. They are constantly ripping up squares and walkways only to repave and re-landscape them with ever more elaborate modern sculptures, fountains and hedges. The last school I worked for spent 18 months ‚Äúimproving‚Äù the lawn in front of my office building. Among other things, they dug a massive winding trench through it, which they filled with water to make an artificial creek. Then they planted weird reeds everywhere and constructed various bridges so pedestrians could traverse their fake wetland.

https://shubhamjain.co/2024/04/16/voice-is-bad-ui/,Voice is (mostly) a Bad UI | Shubham Jain," Humane's AI Pin is in the news and unsurprisingly, it's been universally [panned by reviewers](https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1779641280110161957). I don't have anything to add there. I appreciate the courage to invent a new paradigm, but there are no excuses for shipping something so pointless after raising hundreds of millions.   What I want to discuss is voice as an interface.   Movies like Her have led us to believe that voice is the ultimate user interface. Why bother with a keyboard and mouse, when you can just ""talk it out."" Just a few days ago, I heard about a talk where someone was claiming that it's only a matter of time before every app becomes a voice interface that uses AI agents to accomplish tasks.   I can't help but think that these assumptions carry only a surface-level understanding of the human mind.  Of course, voice as input is nowhere near as polished today, but let's assume it does become so in the near future. Is Voice poised to take over as the universal interface? I don't believe that for many reasons.   1. **Voice is inherently incapable of representing abstract thoughts:** When we use tools we heavily use our subconscious mind and abstract thoughts. For eg, writing and researching. Both of these activities heavily use those abilities. I won't be able to finish any article if I have to narrate everything. That's because while sometimes I have sentences fully formed in my brain, more often, I only have bits and pieces and I have to take time to string them together. I have to search for the right words, link the right ideas, or find the right research.      Voice exercises part of the brain that belongs to the 'consciousness' category, which limits these capabilities.   2. **Voice makes quite a few things harder not easier:** Theoretically, saying, ""order an Uber to airport"" seems like the easiest way to accomplish the task. But is it? What kind of Uber? UberXL, UberGo? There's a 1.5x surge pricing. Acceptable? Is the pickup point correct? What would be easier, resolving each of those queries through a computer asking questions, or taking a quick look yourself on the app?       Another example is food ordering. What would you prefer, going through the menu from tens of restaurants yourself or constantly nudging the AI for the desired option? Technological improvement can only help so much here since users themselves don't clearly know what you want.  3. **Voice is privacy invading:** Most humans are quite self-conscious and they don't want to be seen as in public making requests to a computer. Hell, even with friends or a partner, it might get awkward. It's not just about suspicious requests, people can get paranoid about being judged even for banal ones. Checking messages, for example. This could post questions in mind like: ""How frequently this guy wants to check his messages?"", ""Doesn't he have anything else to do?"".   4. **UI is preferable to understand the limits of software**: UI is not a hinderance, it helps us understand the capabilities of software. For eg, Google Maps. Say you want a route that isn't narrow or bad or a route that takes you through beautiful surroundings. It won't be able to do that because it doesn't have that data. Nor, without the UI it'd be easy to discover that you can check the traffic conditions between two locations for a certain departure time.  5. **Users don't like talking all the time:** Using voice to accomplish simple tasks like setting a timer or an alarm is okay, but to accomplish everything can quickly become annoying. We don't even realize how many micro-tasks we accomplish throughout the day by familiar interfaces. Checking calendar, emails, messages, browsing. Of course, some of these tasks are a way to kill time, but killing time, too, is an important part of our culture, which isn't going anywhere.  6. **Voice can't resolve real-world ambiguities:** There can be tons of ambiguities in an instruction that can't be easily resolved by a voice-only interface. For example, say you want to sell 500 shares of a certain company, which amounts to 50% of your holdings. But, it was a mistaken assumption, 500 shares represent 100% of your holdings. AI won't be able to sense what you want to accomplish because it can't read your brain.       Of course, you can make the same mistake on UI, but it would be more difficult since there's visual feedback about your action. An audio confirmation prompt won't be that effective as it's not easy to visualize the numbers in your head.  ------------------------------------------  Overall, I am not convinced Voice is the future. There are too many inherent problems in not having a screen you can interact with. And even if you add a screen, Voice makes it harder to achieve many things that can be done more easily with a better UI. I don't think, even if AI was perfectly capable of understanding human voice and had zero latency, we would reach a future that Humane is envisioning.

But is generating code for programming languages like JavaScript and Python the right path to take? I think not. I think we should be generating code for declarative languages like Excel or SQL. What's the difference, you ask? In declarative languages, you express what your intention is. For example, in Excel, you can use SUM() to add all the line items and calculate the order amount. If the quantity of a line item changes, it will automatically recalculate the line item amount and then invoke SUM() to recalculate the order amount. But in imperative languages like JavaScript or Python, you instruct the computer on how to calculate the order amount. You would implement a function to add the line items as the order amount. Anytime the quantity of a line item changes, it is your job to call the function and recalculate the order amount. Why is this important? If you are asking AI to generate code for your requirements, you are essentially expressing your intent. So, expressing it in a declarative language seems natural. This will help the person who gave the requirement to understand the code generated by the AI. On the other hand, generating code for a programming language seems like the worst form of leaky abstraction (https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/). ""Leaky abstraction"" describes a scenario where attempts to simplify a system end up requiring users to understand its underlying complexities to troubleshoot it. Code generation can automate the creation process. But, the resulting code can be a puzzle even to a skilled developer who is debugging it. The person who gave the requirement will most likely not understand any of it. So, why do AI companies generate code like this? I guess it comes down to the availability of training data for AI. There are a lot of open-source projects in JavaScript or Python, so it is easy to train AI with it. But open-source projects in Excel are almost non-existent. So, the unavailability of training data might be the primary reason behind the direction these code generation AI companies are taking. At Neartail, we are taking a middle road. We have created a declarative language using JavaScript syntax so that we could train the AI as well as make it understandable to business owners. Will other AI companies realize the perils of leaky abstraction and change its course? Only time will tell.",https://cdn.neartail.com/1FAIpQLScjbts-yMOruG0IK47bi0s9ciOCA6pyW7RlmwKwcFIRnw9HUQ/1713821551398/logoorg/1713821551262.webp,2024-04-25T13:42:39.342850934Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40122919,

https://kwakubiney.github.io/posts/When-I-Realized-I-Was-Not-That-Guy/,When I Realized I Was Not That Guy | Kwaku's thoughts,"A discussion about a design question on the DevCongress slack today brought back a very funny but revealing period in my life so I decided to write about it! So earlier in 2022, I had just started diving into the world of low level engineering. Fascinated by all these talks made by engineers who had done crazy things in the CS world, I could not wait to get my hands dirty. At the time I was building Remixify, which did not really do so well, because there was zero promo for it and just when I was about to release it, Heroku took away the free tier and I said flip it. It‚Äôs rotting on my GitHub somewhere at the moment. At this point, I was tired of building Remixify, I felt it was not stimulating enough, at the time. Or I was just bored, cause I asked myself, why would anyone want remixed versions of songs on their Spotify playlists in the first place? Maybe a handful, but was not encouraging enough to continue. I tweeted on my account for project ideas, and a friend of mine, Ahornam, sent me a link where someone was trying to build something similar to sqlite, with a well laid out approach and everything. It was written in C, and I barely know C, so I set out to build something similar in Go. I can‚Äôt even lie, it was a fun experience. I encountered so many problems when I was trying to port the solution to Go, and also trying to understand what exactly was going on in the tutorial.",,2024-07-15T00:33:09.684667268Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40618088,6005
